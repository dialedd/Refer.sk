# Refer.sk
Simple refering system for minecraft | made in skript

Many safety features, to prevent work around/trading of /refer

after a player joins they can do /refer (user), you can set it so both players or only 1 gets a reward, and a leader board
also a playtime feature, so a player must have playtime between 2 points, to prevent playeres from trading /refers and to stop alting
also comes with a couple commands to set playtime and stuff like that
this skript also uses a list to check if a player has used /refer, so because of that i added a /referremove so u can give people there /refer back

to install just install skript, and probably skbee lol
then just add the skript to scripts folder
then just /sk reload refer.sk
